## Development conventions

### Api end points naming

-   REST conventions are being followed.
-   CRUD end points for a User resource would look like:
    -   GET <mark>/api/users/</mark>
    -   GET <mark>/api/users/user_id</mark>
    -   POST <mark>/api/users/</mark>
    -   PUT <mark>/api/users/:user_id</mark>
    -   DELETE <mark>/api/users/:user_id</mark>
-   Route parameteres should be named in snake_case as shown above.

### Code style

-   `Pep8` has been used to standardized variable names, classes, module names etc.
-   `Pylint` is the linting tool used to analyze the code as per Pep8 style.
-   `Black` is used as the code formatter.

### Setting up your vscode env

-   Recommended IDE is VsCode.
-   Install the pylint extension in vscode and enable it.
-   Set the default format provider in vscode as `black`
-   Update the vscode settings.json as follows<br>
    `    {
"editor.defaultFormatter": null,
"python.linting.enabled": true,
"python.formatting.provider": "black",
"editor.formatOnSave": true
}`

### Running pylint

-   In your virtual environment run `pylint ddpui/`
